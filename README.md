# About
PyChat is a simple GUI-equipped chat program written in Python that features:
- A GUI with customizable graphical and auditory settings
- A (CLI) server that features a configuration wizard
- Multiple user and admin commands (with PIN protection)

Please Note: PyChat is by no means encrypted, and the only security it offers is obscurity. I am not responsible if your juicy secrets get stolen by someone with Wireshark and a handful of free time.
