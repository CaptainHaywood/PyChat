#Main Client

Above is the main client window.

The message pane is customizable in text and background color, with B/W/G and ROYGBIV colors available. However, it defaults to a standard black and white.

#Connection Manager

This is the Connection Management window. It allows you to view your current connection, as well as connecting to a new server. If PyChat cannot successfully connect to a server, you will be notified.

#Help and Commands
![help](https://imgur.com/2T9ZrkQ.png)

The Help window is fairly self-explanatory. It contains a list of all available commands.

- /leave disconnects you from the server.
- /cloak broadcasts that you have left the chat, but you remain connected.
- /uncloak broadcasts that you have rejoined the chat from cloak.
- /clear clears the message pane.
- /name changes your handle.

- Admin PIN commands require the user to enter a PIN that is assigned server side. By default it is 0000.

- /silence prevents any messages from being sent.
- /noise disables silence.
- /broadcast will broadcast a message of your choice under the server name, configurable in the server wizard.

#Settings

The Settings window has three options.

- Notification Sound. PyChat includes three different tones, and you can replace the files with a different tone if you so desire.
- Text Color - The color of messages in the message pane.
- Background Color - The color of the message pane's background.

Changes will only go into effect after a program restart.
