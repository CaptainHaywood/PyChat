Above is the main client window.

The message pane is customizable in text and background color, with B/W/G and ROYGBIV colors available. However, it defaults to a standard black and white.

This is the Connection Management window. It allows you to view your current connection, as well as connecting to a new server. If PyChat cannot successfully connect to a server, you will be notified.

The Help window is fairly self-explanatory. It contains a list of all available commands.

The Settings window has three options.

- Notification Sound. PyChat includes three different tones, and you can replace the files with a different tone if you so desire.
- Text Color - The color of messages in the message pane.
- Background Color - The color of the message pane's background.

Changes will only go into effect after a program restart.

  The About window is only included here for posterity.
